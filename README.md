### Project Summary
This Netflix application was created using Visual Studio Code and React.js. The goal for this application was to try and replicate the Netflix application as much as possible, while becoming more familiar with React.js. In order to successfully build this application I followed numerous tutorials which helped me build a stronger React.js foundation. 

Thanks to this application I was able to expand on a ton of React.js concepts and also become more familiar with some of Javascript's libraries. One thing I would like to mention regarding this application is the subscription plan. User's are currently able to create an account without having to purchase a subsription plan. I left this feature how it is because if altered, the user would be forced to subscribe to a subscription before viewing the home page. I decided to not force the user to subscribe to use the application. However, if a user does decide to subscribe to a plan, they can click the avatar logo on the top right, and subscribe to a plan. Once they click on their plan they will automatically be sent to the Stripe payment processing. There they can use Stripe's test card for their payment. All you would need to do is put 4242 in all input fields that require numbers. Here's the documentation for additional help [Stripe Testing Card Number](https://stripe.com/docs/testing)

### Learning Objectives:
- Setting up a React App infrastructure.
- Create a Firebase project for hosting, database, and authentication.
- Incorporate Redux.
- Create TMDB account for movie info.
- Become familiar with TMDB's API.
- Add the Axios library to help us make http requests to external api.
- Include React Router Dom.
- Implement meaningful documentation to better assist on updates.
- Follow industry standards for styling.
- Create Stripe account to be able to include payment processing.
- Add Stripe extension through Firebase to connect Stripe account to Firebase account.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
